# EagleOwlsGenderDifference

## Introduction:
This repository contains the collaborative work of Group 1 for the lecture "Python in GIS" 
held by [Junior Professor Dr. Judith Verstegen](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/institute/staff/index.php/274/Judith_Verstegen) at Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster during the summer semester of 2019. <br>

The members of Group 1 are:<br>
* [Viktor Gorte](https://github.com/vgorte) <br>
* [Sarah Lechler](https://github.com/SarahLechler) <br>
* [Niklas Philippi](https://github.com/nPhil01) <br>
* [Sebastian Holtkamp](https://github.com/sholtkamp) <br>

## Topic:
The aim of this project was to analyze whether we could find differences in performance of eagle owls based on their sex.
Therefore, we wrote PyQGIS scripts to analyze the data set provided from Reinhard Vohwinkel at [movebank.org](https://www.movebank.org/panel_embedded_movebank_webapp). <br>

## Instructions:
The required data structure to run the code of this repository is:
* .gitignore 
* [scripts.py] 
* finalAssignment.qgz 
* README.md 
* data 
  * csv 
    * eagle_owl.csv 
  * shapefiles 
    * lines.shp 
    * points.shp 

To run the code open finalAssignment.qgz in QGIS and enter the scripts in the python console.
